                            The ATLAS dataset was largely acquired at the University Hospital, Dijon 21 000,
                            France and consists of real-world clinical acquisitions of HCC. The ATLAS dataset was
                            anonymized and processed in accordance with the rules established by the Ethical
                            Committee of the University Hospital of Dijon. All administrative information
                            included in the metadata has been removed, making it untraceable. Thus, in accordance
                            with the French law it was not necessary to go through the process of obtaining an
                            ethical approval number.

                            Since the dataset was acquired over 11 years the quality of patient care and quality of
                            acquisitions has gradually improved. Thus, there is a domain shift between the older and more recent
                            acquisitions, most recent acquisitions being more likely to resemble future
                            acquisitions. For this reason, the test set consists of the most recent patients
                            of the dataset. The test dataset will be released when the website closes at the end of 2025.

                            The CE-MRI (gadolinium-based contrast agents) images of the ATLAS dataset were mainly acquired on five Siemens
                            1.5T and 3T MRI machines. Few acquisitions were made on General Electric (GE) 1.5T MRI machines.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2">
                            Each acquisition is T1-weighted in the transversal axis with an ultrafast gradient
                            echo sequence. On Siemens equipment, Volumetric Interpolated Breath-hold Examination
                            (VIBE) sequence was used or a derived VIBE sequence, such as VIBE TWIST or VIBE CAIPIRINHA.
                            On GE equipment, Liver Acquisition with Volume Acquisition (LAVA) or LAVA FLEX sequences
                            were used. Fat saturation (FATSAT) is applied for all acquisitions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-2">
                            Each exam results in three to five CE-MR images, one image is selected to be added to the
                            dataset. The selected image is usually one of the three post-contrast injection phases
                            (arterial, portal or delayed) that is also used by the experts to delineate the liver
                            and tumor(s). In some rare cases, the selected image is done without agent contrast injection.
                        </p>

                            Finally, a CE-MRI of the ATLAS dataset consists of a 3D image of 44 to 136 transversal
                            slices of the thorax and abdomen covering the entire liver and tumor. Each slice has a
                            pixel spacing between 0.68 x 0.68 mm² and 1.41 x 1.41mm², and the slice thickness is between
                            2mm and 4mm.

                            Using the selected CE-MRI, the liver and tumor(s) contours were manually delineated by
                            an experienced MRI radiologist on transverse slices to produce the labels.
                            No pre-processing was applied.
